# Meta Blog

Meta Blog serves as a platform to display blog posts that are stored in supabase database. The application is designed to showcase best practices in Next.js development, including efficient data fetching, client-side rendering, and seamless navigation. The primary goal of this project is to enhance my skills and knowledge in Next.js v14. There is a GitHub workflow to run the unit tests before each pull request and it's only allowed to merge after the green result.
